We are SUPERMILK. (stylized with a dot at the end), a small game developer studio based in Switzerland.
Our goal is to make _games for everyone_, but not in a game-design sense. We want to make games that are affordable
not only with regard to their pricing, but also by keeping in mind that they should run on low-end machines effortlessly.

During our projects, we aim to maintain transparency towards people interested in the development of our games. This is in order
to make sure of two things:
- We are pressurized to deliver and by extension working on our projects
- We can keep ourselves open to ideas and/or criticism even in the early stages of delevopment

We also might start working on small side-projects, in which we would learn some techniques that we would like to apply to our main projects. Currently, we're mainly working on two projects:

- A JRPG-style game
- A dungeon crawler

Since neither I nor the other member of SUPERMILK. are particularly good writers (a fact we are actively trying to work on), and I do not know what to add, here is our logo to fill up some space :)
